# Additional Info

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.

The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo [here](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-kotlin-jvm/blob/main/openapi.json).

When updating the `org.openapi.generator` plugin ensure that any custom templates are appropriately modified or removed. These can be found in the .openapi-generator/templates directory.

The generation always happens on preBuild so triggering a project build will regenerate them.

## Wrapping CompletableFuture

### RxJava

Rx provides a `fromFuture` method that will trigger `future.get()` which is a blocking call so it must be moved off the main thread.

Disposing the resulting observable will not cancel the future so that needs to be done manually using `doOnDispose`.

```kt
val future = immutableX.cancelOrder(orderId)
Observable.fromFuture(future)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .doOnDispose { future.cancel(true) }
    .subscribe({ handleSuccess() }, { handleError() })
```

### Coroutines

The Kotlin team has a set of packages for jdk8 that provide an easy extension for using CompletableFuture.

First add this import to your project:

```gradle
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8:$coroutines_version"
```

Then simply call `.await()` on the workflow `CompletableFuture` and wrap it with a try/catch to handle any exceptions.

```kt
launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    try {
        val id = immutableX.cancelOrder(orderId).await()
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        handleError(e)
    }
}
```
