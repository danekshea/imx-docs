# SDKs overview

Immutable provide SDKs for a range of languages and frameworks that make it easy for application developers to execute basic, as well as more advanced, functionality.

#### We have two types of SDK:

| | Functionality | Description | SDKs available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Core** | Facilitates key functionality of the ImmutableX platform. Provides a wrapper for the API endpoints as well as workflow functions that make common actions easier to implement. | <ul><li>[Core SDK (recommended)](#core--wallet-sdk)</li><li>[JS SDK](#link--js-sdk)</li></ul> |
| **2** | **User wallet interactions** | Enables applications to facilitate [user transactions](#what-are-user-transactions) by connecting with user wallets on various platforms and enabling user authorization (signing) of state-updating transactions (ie. creating sell orders, transferring ownership of assets). Often used in conjunction with the core SDKs. | <ul><li>[Wallet SDK](#core--wallet-sdk)</li><li>[Link SDK](#link--js-sdk)</li></ul> |

#### ***What are user transactions?***
User transactions are those that deal with changes in asset ownership that require the approval (signature) of asset owners. These transactions update the state of things on the blockchain, as opposed to just reading data.

## How do the SDKs work together?

### Core + Wallet SDK
The **[Core SDK](#core-sdks)** is responsible for the bulk of functionality that is available on the ImmutableX platform. It can be used with the **[Wallet SDK](#wallet-sdks)** in order to establish a connection with users' wallets to sign certain transactions that require users' approval.

### Link + JS SDK
The **[Link SDK](#link-sdk)** provides end-to-end functionality for the bulk of user transactions, including a user interface for users to see, sign and approve these transactions. It uses the **[JS SDK](#js-sdk)** for its backend operations, like creating orders or trades. 

**See [Guides](/docs/basic-guides) on how to use our SDKs.**
