# Launch a collection

Launching a collection with ImmutableX means having a [token smart contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens) deployed where tokens can be freely transacted (ie. minted, traded, bought and sold) on ImmutableX's layer 2.

:::info Minting tokens on layer 2
If you want to be able to mint tokens on layer 2 from your smart contract, see [these requirements](../smart-contract-requirements/index.md).
:::

#### You must do the following:
1. [Register yourself as a user on ImmutableX](../register-as-user/index.md)
2. [Register an administrative entity, a project, on ImmutableX](../register-project/index.mdx)
3. [Register the smart contract as a collection on ImmutableX](../register-collection/index.mdx)
4. [Register collection metadata schema](../register-metadata-schema/index.md)
