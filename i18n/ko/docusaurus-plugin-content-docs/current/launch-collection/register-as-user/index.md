Registering as a user on ImmutableX means to generate an ImmutableX L2 wallet for an Ethereum L1 wallet so that you can transact on L2. 

Please read [here](../../guides/basic-guides/register-users/index.md) for more information on this process.

### Steps:
1. [Get an Ethereum (L1) wallet](#1-get-an-ethereum-l1-wallet)
2. [Register as a user](#2-register-as-a-user)
2. [Get test ETH](#3-get-test-eth)

You can register as a user on our [main Ethereum marketplace](https://market.immutable.com/), or on our [sandbox marketplace](https://market.sandbox.immutable.com/) if you're just testing.

## 1. Get an Ethereum (L1) wallet
The easiest way of registering as a user on ImmutableX is to connect your wallet to the Immutable marketplace ([Ethereum](https://market.immutable.com/), [sandbox](https://market.sandbox.immutable.com/)).

This connect wallet functionality supports the following wallet applications:
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
* [Magic](https://magic.link/) - start the set up process by clicking on 'Connect' in the Immutable Marketplace
* [Gamestop](https://wallet.gamestop.com/) (only Ethereum marketplace)

Once you've created your wallet, you may have to set your network to the same as the marketplace: `Ethereum` or `Goërli`.

## 2. Register as a user
There are two ways to register as a user:
1. [Connect in the Immutable Marketplace](#connect-in-the-immutable-marketplace)
2. [Use imx-examples repository](#use-imx-examples-repository)

### Connect in the Immutable Marketplace
Click on 'Connect' and follow the prompts

### Use [imx-examples](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#1-register-as-a-user-with-immutable-x) respository
1. Get the private key for the wallet that you created (go [here](https://reveal.magic.link/immutable) if you created a Magic wallet)
2. Follow the steps in `1. Register as a user with ImmutableX` [here](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#1-register-as-a-user-with-immutable-x)

## 3. Get test ETH
In order to make transactions while testing on Goerli, you’ll need to fund your wallet with some ETH. Here are some faucets where you can get some:
* https://goerlifaucet.com/
* https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/
* https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/

Sometimes all faucets are dried up at once. There are others. [Join the conversation](https://discord.gg/TkVumkJ9D6) in Discord for help if you cannot find any.
