As the ImmutableX community has grown, we've received an increasing number of requests for marketing support to help with the growth of projects. We want to support as many projects as possible, and reward those that are building their communities and, once launched, are achieving a high volume of transactions.

Therefore we have created a tiered marketing support approach. The more you build your community, the more support we can give you! Check out the criteria below to see which tier you qualify for.

## Tiered marketing support

After you have determined what tier your project is in, please carefully read the [terms and conditions](#terms-and-conditions) before submitting your application for marketing support.
