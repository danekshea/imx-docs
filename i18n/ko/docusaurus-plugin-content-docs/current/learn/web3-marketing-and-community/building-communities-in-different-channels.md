# Introduction

In this article we will cover the basics for building your community on Twitter and Discord. These channels are the most prominent in Web3, and we will briefly touch upon other channels later in the article. Feel free to mix and match these tactics to your own channels, and note that these tips are a guideline since tactics will continually evolve.

## **Twitter**

Twitter is the primary user acquisition channel for Web3 natives, and remains an important channel for engaging with Web2 gamers.

### Growth

Every Twitter account starts from 0. Here are some tips to help grow your community over time:

- **High impact content first** : While frequency and cadence matters, prioritize a single high-quality trailer, video or visual that highlights your mission and brand overall. This can be used for partnerships, pitches, and across all channels.
- **Establish a brand** : Make sure Twitter image, description, header and links build brand and provide clarity.
- **Giveaways** : while giveaways shouldn't be relied upon in the long term, they can generate some short term buzz around a particular announcement or activation.
- **Micro -\> Macro Influencers** : Consider partnering with a team that can facilitate influencer networks to help promote. For a new account, consider starting with micro influencers (3k-30k followers) as these may be the most interested in your mission.
- **Drive traffic to Twitter** : Other marketing channels such as Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Youtube and Website should drive to Twitter.
- **Give it time** : Don't assume a community will necessarily explode over night. Examples of these viral communities exist, but are rare.

### Engagement

- **Twitter Spaces** : Organize a cadence of Twitter Spaces and have your community leadership team discuss upcoming news and changes while fielding questions.
- **Create a narrative or story:** Get artists to create assets and break this out into multiple pieces of content that tells a story over time. This is good bang-for-buck in content production and engages the community in a meaningful way over time (also consider [questing mechanics](https://crew3.xyz/) as part of this).
- **Get involved in conversations** : Pay attention to trends in Web2 or Web3 Twitter. Savvy use of trending hashtags and memes can position a tweet well in a broader conversation, but be mindful not to overuse.
- **Use a consistent TOV** : Being consistent with tone and content makes your content quickly recognisable in feed. When appropriate, consider using memes. Meme content can empower the community with a sense of insidership.
- **Drive fans deeper into the ecosystem** : Twitter followers is a great early engagement metric. From here encourage discord sign ups (or email/initiative specific signups for upcoming drops).
- **Highlight user content and stories** : Liking, retweeting and responding to community content encourages engagement. This can be done through direct tweets or even facilitated through events and competitions.
- **Use pinned tweets:** If an announcement or trailer is important, leave that as a pinned tweet for new users to see and get context when they arrive on the page.
- **Keep posting** : Frequently engaging and posting at least once a day (ideally more) is recommended. Not every tweet will yield immediate results, but momentum will build over time.

## Discord

Discord is the primary community destination for Web3 natives. Along with Twitter, it serves as a real-time hub for discussions and announcements. Discord is significantly more modular than Twitter, allowing customizations and integrations that creatively shape the community's experience.

### Setting up Discord

**Make your Discord easy to navigate with channels and categories**

- Be deliberate in creating channels to cater to different topics and purposes
- Segment different channels into categories for clear organization
- Include an international segment with different key languages based on your audience
- Avoid creating too many channels too early. For discords with \<5k users, keep a small number of channels to consolidate conversation.

**Find active moderators across time zones to keep the server alive at all hours**

- Seek out the most engaged community members and promote them to moderators

**Growth**

- **Make Discord a project homebase** : Tease Discord exclusive information and content through your other social channels and website, driving fans back to Discord.
- **Competitions and giveaways** : Run giveaways specifically on Discord, or require fans to join your discord to be eligible for competition entry.
- **Live events** : Host events such as panels, fireside chats and AMAs directly on Discord. This is an opportunity to grow your Discord as well as engage new and existing fans. POAPs can even be used to give fans a takeaway.
- **Collaborate with other projects** : Connect with partners who can provide value to your fans. Invite them to events on Discord and cross-pollinate between communities.
- **Creative a positive #general channel:** The main public chatting channel, often called the #general channel, will be a primary destination for discussion. Ensure participation and oversight from moderators to make this a great experience for new and existing fans.

### Engagement

- **Be active and exclusive:** Without ongoing discussion and early bird content drops, fans can lose interest in checking a Discord. Make sure Discord is the primary channel for new content, giving fans a sense of 'insidership' and the feeling of being first-to-know.
- **Treat Discord as a product:** Regularly undertakeuser journey research, testing, and UX iteration to validate the Discord experience from a fans' perspective.
- **Establish 'roles' as incentives:** Be clear about the different 'roles' that can be delegated to fans. By establishing a sense of ownership, hierarchy and significance (such as key fans being promoted to moderators), fans will be encouraged to work towards roles.
- **Create a 'Discord Map':** Similar to an FAQ, create a static channel that serves as a map of the Discord. This can be used as both an onboarding flow and a general organizational tool.
- **Consider third-party integrations:** Third party integrations allow increasing customization options such as gating parts of the server to NFT owners, verifying new users to prevent botting and implementing questing systems to incentivize behaviour. Integrations to consider include
  - Setup and Management (necessary - choose one): Such as [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/), [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/), [Carl Bot](https://carl.gg/), [ProBot](https://probot.io/) or similar
  - Anti Raid (necessary): Such as [Beemo](https://beemo.gg/) or similar
  - Discord Utility (nice to have): Such as [Collab Land](https://collab.land/), [Server Stats Bot](https://serverstatsbot.com/) or similar
  - Recording AMAs (nice to have): Such as [Craig](https://craig.chat/) or similar


As always, make sure you do your own research when picking a tool to make sure it suits your needs - the above are simply examples of tools we have come across.

### Additional Channels

- YouTube - Great for trailers, gameplay videos, sneak peeks
- Reddit - Announcements, AMAs, monitor for user sentiment
- Telegram - Similar functionality to Discord, decide whether you can maintain both
- Facebook - Less common in Web3, but enables paid advertising
- Instagram - Useful for announcements if audience is Web2
- TikTok - Can be useful if targeting Gen Z

## General health check in

Here are some general questions you can ask to check the state of your community:

1. What is the _size_ of your community?
  - Total Discord Users
2. How _engaged_ is your community?
  - Ratio of online members to total members
  - Total # messages / total # users (1-2 messages per user indicates heavy bot presence/ low engagement. A high number per user indicates high engagement)
3. Is your community _converting_ from other channels?
  - Twitter Followers / # Discord Followers (we consider a ratio \>1 successful).
4. Is your community _retained_ or _churning_?
  - Is volume engagement increasing, static or decreasing over time?

Some projects also have a weekly sentiment check where one member of the team will summarize the current community sentiment. This can include the general sentiment as well as reactions to specific events.
