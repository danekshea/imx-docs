## Introduction

Fundraising for your Web3 gaming project is one of the single biggest tasks to navigate. In the world of Web3, many options are available to you. From traditional methods including family and friends, angel investors and venture capital. While each method of fundraising has its own nuances to executing it correctly, there are lots also in common. This guide is intended to give some generalised advice to help you achieve the funding objectives you and your team are looking for, however you should seek independent financial, legal, tax or other professional advice suited to your specific circumstances before making any decisions.

## What is fundraising?

There are different methods to raise funding for your project, both in equity and debt. The most common methods to raise funding today are:

- Equity investment from accredited investors or venture funds
- Project grants from protocols
- Crowdfunding pre-sales to the public

While there are pros and cons to each method, typically projects will use a combination of these techniques to achieve the capital requirements for the project. The common thread for all these methods is getting the pitch story right.

## Why is fundraising important?

Not all businesses need to raise funds to kickstart their development. The opposite of a funded business is "bootstrapped", where the business is started based on either founders' own capital or from revenues generated. The issue with gaming projects is that most are quite capital intensive and require lots of development to get to launch and beyond. This means, unless you have lots of funding capital yourself, there's every chance you'll be in a position in which you'll need to raise funds somewhere in your journey.

Fundraising successfully helps you with a number of key benefits:

- Gives you money to accelerate - In a competitive market of multiple builders building similar projects, speed matters. Funding helps you move faster than the competition.
- Build public profile for your project - Particularly where you're able to achieve landmark fundraising totals or raise from well known investors, doing a successful funding round will help make your project a household name.
- Give you access to experts that you otherwise wouldn't have - Finally, the most important aspect is fundraising allows you to fill out your team's shortcomings, by bringing in those (venture funds, former founders, strategic partners, customers) who can meaningfully help change the likelihood of your project being a success.
