# Introduction

In the NFT space a successful launch is critical to building a project's long-term momentum and sending the market a signal that your project is a winner. So how do you engineer success and ensure a successful launch, and is that even possible? Yes! While macro trends are a reality, the decisions you make can set your launch up for success against your goals. In this series, we intend to answer that question by sharing with you the launch mechanics and what we think about at Immutable when launching a project.

Note: In this series, we will use the term "launch" to refer to an NFT drop, although most concepts also apply to a game going live.

# What is Success

For the purpose of this series, a successful launch is defined by two things:

1. It sells out within a short, pre-defined time frame
2. It meets your project goals (more on this later)

It's important for your launch to sell out to send a signal to the market that this project is a winner. Time and time again, we've seen NFT projects on every chain fail to be successful in their first launch and subsequently be unable to regain any momentum they once had.

Conversely, projects like Illuvium, which carefully designed their launch, executed one of the biggest Web3 sales of all time in June (on ImmutableX), raking in $72M in primary sales despite bearish market conditions. The result of the successful launch was that the project garnered overwhelmingly positive community sentiment and excitement for the next launch.

Consider a theoretical example: which of the following projects do you think people are most likely to investigate further?

- Game A that sold 5K swords in a day
- Game B that dropped 50K swords, but only 7K sold out 2 weeks later

Clearly, Game A will be viewed by the market as more successful than Game B, despite Game B having sold more assets. Game A's developers have achieved what they set out to do (i.e. sell 5k in game assets ) which sends a signal to the market that they can deliver, as well as driving FOMO within their audience.

We can see from this example, as well as countless examples in the Web3 space, that selling out should be one of, if not the most, important priorities when designing your launch.

# Defining Launch Goals

The first step of designing a strong launch is to articulate **why you are launching** , i.e. determining how this launch solves your overall project goals. You can then define your launch goals, which help you make design decisions and tradeoffs (more on this later). While you can (and probably should) have a mix of goals, it's important to define a "north star" purpose for your launch that can be used to guide decision making.

There are many reasons why you would do an NFT drop, but these are two **primary reasons** that we frequently see at Immutable.

## Community Building

Launches that are primarily focused on community building aim to use their launch to build a user base who are invested in the project's success. Some of the design decisions that are prioritized by this type of launch are:

- Utility for holders (either in-game, or in the community)
- Accessible pricing for assets so more community members can own assets
- Open access to minting for everyone, or at a minimum, open access to minting for the community
- Transparency on launch details

## Market validation

Launches that focus on market validation are similar to pre sales - these focus on determining need and desire for your offering. Some of the design decisions that are prioritized by this type of launch are:

- Social signaling (social status associated with holding this NFT)
- Whitelist access and FOMO
- Speculation and lower transparency on launch details
- Value discovery (auctions can be used to determine market value)
- Higher price points

These examples demonstrate why it's critical to understand your primary launch reason. Launches that focus on market validation can risk lowering community sentiment. Conversely, launches that prioritize community building may lead to lower asset demand. Therefore, each project needs to carefully consider their priorities and trade offs to set their project on the path to success.
