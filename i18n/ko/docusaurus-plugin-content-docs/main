# SDKs overview

Immutable provide SDKs for a range of languages and frameworks that make it easy for application developers to execute basic, as well as more advanced, functionality.

There are three types provided:
* **[Core SDKs](#core-sdks)** - provides a wrapper for the API endpoints as well as workflow functions that make common actions easier to implement. It facilitates all the functionality that the Immutable X platform provides.
* **[Wallet SDKs](#wallet-sdks)** - enables applications to facilitate [user transactions](#what-are-user-transactions) by connecting with user wallets on various platforms and enabling user authorization (signing) of state-updating transactions (ie. creating sell orders, transferring ownership of assets). It can be used with the Core SDK.
* **[Link SDK](../main/guides/link-sdk/index.md)** - provides all functionality required to facilitate [user transactions](#what-are-user-transactions), including a user interface for users to see, sign and approve these transactions.

#### ***What are user transactions?***
User transactions are those that deal with changes in asset ownership that require the approval (signature) of asset owners. These transactions update the state of things on the blockchain, as opposed to just reading data.

## How do the SDKs work together?

The **Core SDK** is responsible for the bulk of functionality that is available on the Immutable X platform. It can be used with the **Wallet SDK** in order to establish a connection with users' wallets to sign certain transactions that require users' approval.

The **Link SDK** provides end-to-end functionality for the bulk of user transactions and does not need to be used in conjunction with other SDKs.
