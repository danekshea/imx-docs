# Overview

The Immutable Core SDK C# provides convenient access to the ImmutableX API and Ethereum smart contracts for applications written on the ImmutableX platform.

Currently, this SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/starkex/). In the future, when we start supporting other rollups, this SDK will also provide access to those.
