# Set up endpoints required for the Moonpay NFT primary sale checkout feature

:::caution Feature for managed partners only
This is a feature intended for managed partners. If you are not a managed partner and would like to become one, please reach out to us on our [#dev-discussion channel](https://discord.gg/7URHuYFCN4) on Discord. 

If you are a managed partner, your partner success manager needs to set up a commercial partnership with Moonpay for you in order to implement the [primary NFT sale checkout feature](../link-sdk/link-nft-checkout-primary.md). Please reach out to them to facilitate this.
:::

The [Moonpay primary NFT sale checkout feature](../link-sdk/link-nft-checkout-primary.md) enables users to mint and own an asset using a credit card.

In order to use this feature, you need to complete the following:
1. Establish a commercial partnership with Moonpay (your partner success manager will facilitate this for you)
2. [Register with ImmutableX with the required endpoints](#how-to-set-up-and-register-endpoints)

## How to set up and register endpoints

### 1. Create endpoints 

You are required to provide the following endpoints:

1. [Trigger the mint](#triggering-the-mint-endpoint): An endpoint to mint the asset once payment has been confirmed with Moonpay
2. [Get asset info](#get-asset-info-endpoint): An endpoint to get information about the minted asset and render the checkout

### Triggering the mint endpoint

#### Headers required:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IMX-Signature` - [How to validate this](#3-how-to-validate-the-imx-signature) | Signature to confirm that the request was made by ImmutableX |
| `IMX-Timestamp` - [How to generate this](../../key-concepts/deep-dive-api-concepts.md#imx-timestamp-string) | Timestamp header to validate `IMX-Signature` |

#### Request body:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offer_id` | String | The ID of the offer provided for the NFT to be minted |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |
| `user` | String | User that the NFT will be minted for (will become the NFT's owner) |
| `wallet_address` | String | Wallet address that will receive the payment, in crypto (from Moonpay), for the minted NFT |
| `external_transaction_id` | String (UUID) | Unique ImmutableX transaction ID that can be used to get information about the transaction |

#### Response:

| Property | Type | Descrtiption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |
| `token_id` | String | Token ID (as specified by the NFT smart contract) of the minted asset |
| `tx_id` | Integer | Minting transaction ID - see [mintTokens](/reference#/operations/mintTokens) response |

#### Example:

```shell
Request: POST /mint
headers: {
  "IMX-Signature": "5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd",
  "IMX-Timestamp": "1492774577"
}

data: {
  "offer_id": "string",
  "contract_address": "string",
  "user": "string",
  "wallet_address": "string",
  "external_transaction_id": "string(UUID)",
}

Status: 200
Response: {
  "contract_address": "string",
  "token_id": "string",
  "tx_id": 0
}
```

:::info Error on mint
If minting fails, please provide a response with the error code and message.

```shell
Response: {
 "code": "number", // the error code
 "message": "string", // the error message
 "details": "string" // the error details
}
```
:::

### Get asset info endpoint

This endpoint will be used to get information about the asset to be minted using [trigger mint endpoint](#triggering-the-mint-endpoint).

#### Response:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offer_id` | String | The ID of the offer provided for the NFT to be minted |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |
| `name` | String | Token name to be rendered at checkout |
| `collection` | String | Collection name to be rendered at checkout |
| `image_url` | String | URL where the image to be displayed for the minted asset is hosted |
| `price_currency_code` | String | Currency of the amount to be paid. Choose from: `"ETH"` or `"USDC"` |
| `price` | String | Amount of the currency required to mint the token |
| `seller_address` | String |  Wallet address that will receive the payment, in crypto (from Moonpay), for the minted NFT |

#### Example:

```shell
Example Request: GET /:contract_address/:offer_id

Status: 200
Response: {
 "offer_id": "123",
 "contract_address": "0xacb3...",
 "name": "SiShinylver Card Pack",
 "collection": "Gods Unchained",
 "image_url": "https://images.godsunchained.com/cardpack-images--marketing/256/mortal--neutral--shiny--legendary.png",
 "price": "125.29",
 "price_currency_code": "USD",
 "seller_address": "0xacb3...",
}
```

:::info Unavailable offer
If an offer is unavailable, a response should return `404 - Not Found`.
```
Status: 404
Response: {
 "code": "404", // the error code
 "message": "Missing offer", // the error message
 "details": "The offer id {offer_id} is not a valid offer for purchase" // the error details
}
```

### 2. Register with ImmutableX using created endpoints

When you've set up the endpoints required in the previous step, reach out to your partner success manager to register them with ImmutableX.

After registration, ImmutableX will send you a webhook key that will be used to validate the signature when initiating mint requests.

### 3. How to validate the `IMX-Signature`

Generate a `signed_payload` by concatenating the following:
* `IMX-Timestamp` header
* The character `.`
* JSON payload of the message to be signed

Example:
```ts
const payload = JSON.stringify({
    "offer_id": "1",
    "contract_address": '0x23a...',
    "user": '0x8b1...',
    "wallet_address": '0x11a...',
    "external_transaction_id": "00000000-0000-0000-aaaa-0000a000aa00",
    });
    
const signed_payload = imx_timestamp_header_value + "." + payload;

```

You will then need to compute an HMAC with the SHA-256 hash function using the webhook key that we provided when you [registered the endpoints with ImmutableX](#2-register-with-immutablex-using-created-endpoints) for the `signed_payload` and use it to compare the signature in the header:

```ts
import crypto from "crypto-js"

const generatedSignature = crypto.HmacSHA256(signed_payload, webhookKey).toString();
```
