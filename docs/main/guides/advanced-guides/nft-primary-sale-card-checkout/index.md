# NFT primary sale card checkout

:::caution Feature for managed partners only
This is a feature intended for managed partners. If you are not a managed partner and would like to become one, please reach out to us on our [#dev-discussion channel](https://discord.gg/7URHuYFCN4) on Discord.

If you are a managed partner, your partner success manager needs to set up a commercial partnership with Moonpay for you. Please reach out to them to facilitate this.
:::


Working alongside Moonpay, we have integrated their [NFT Checkout product](https://www.moonpay.com/business/nfts) which allows users to purchase an asset directly via a fiat credit card transaction (with no intermediary purchase of ETH or an ERC20)

This feature requires partners to [complete the setup with ImmutableX](./nft-checkout-primary-setup.md) before starting implementation.

This guide provides information on how to implement **NFT primary sale card checkout** feature with:
* [Core SDK](./nft-checkout-primary-core-sdk.md) and [API](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference/#)
* [Link SDK](../../link-sdk/link-nft-checkout-primary.md)
