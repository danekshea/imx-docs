:::danger OFFERS IS IN BETA
This feature is currently in beta. Some functionality might be restricted or changed without notice. Please contact IMX if you have questions about integrating this feature.
:::

:::note Link reference tool
Check out our **[Link reference tool](https://tools.immutable.com/link-reference/)** to understand how `Link` methods work without having to write any code.
:::

Here's how you can accept an offer:

```typescript
import { Link, ImmutableXClient, ImmutableOrderStatus} from ‘@imtbl/imx-sdk’;
const link = new Link("https://link.sandbox.x.immutable.com")
// accept an offer by passing the orderId of the offer
await link.acceptOffer({
  orderId: '940',
   fees: [  // OPTIONAL
    {
      address: '0x383b14727ac2bD3923f1583789d5385C3A26f91E',
      fee_percentage: 0.5, // equal to 0.5%
    },
  ],
});
```

Just like all other link SDK methods, **acceptOffer** returns a promise, which resolves once all operations are complete, or rejects once the link encounters a critical error.

Input parameters:
```typescript
{
  orderId: string, // order id of the offer to be accepted
  fees?: Array<FeeEntry> // optionally specify seller marketplace fees
}
```
