:::danger OFFERS IS IN BETA
This feature is currently in beta. Some functionality might be restricted or changed without notice. Please contact IMX if you have questions about integrating this feature.
:::

:::note Link reference tool
Check out our **[Link reference tool](https://tools.immutable.com/link-reference/)** to understand how `Link` methods work without having to write any code.
:::

Here's how you can make an offer:

```typescript
import { Link, ImmutableXClient, ImmutableOrderStatus} from '@imtbl/imx-sdk';
const link = new Link("https://link.sandbox.x.immutable.com")
// make an offer for 0.25 ETH
await link.makeOffer({
  tokenId: '123',
  tokenAddress: '0x2ca7e3fa937cae708c32bc2713c20740f3c4fc3b',
  amount: '0.25',
  currencyAddress: ''
   fees: [  // optionally specify buyer marketplace fees in array, protocol and royalty fees are applied automatically
    {
      address: '0x383b14727ac2bD3923f1583789d5385C3A26f91E',
      fee_percentage: 0.5, // equal to 0.5%
    },
  ],
});
// NOTE: removing the currencyAddress property will default to the offer to be in ETH as well
```

Just like all other link SDK methods, **makeOffer** returns a promise, which resolves once all operations are complete, or rejects once the link encounters a critical error.

Input parameters:
```typescript
{
  tokenId: string, // id of the asset
  tokenAddress: string, // contract address of the collection
  amount: string,  // offer amount, must be greater than 0
  currencyAddress?: string, // contract address of the currency token, default is ETH
  expirationTimestamp?: string, // unix timestamp seconds as a string. Must be at least 1 week into the future, defaults to 99 years into the future
  fees?: {
    address: string, // recipient eth address
    fee_percentage: number, // fee percentage
  }[] // optionally specify buyer marketplace fees in array, protocol and royalty fees are applied automatically
}
```

Make offer response:
```typescript
{
  orderId: string, // positive integer string
  status: string
}
/* example response
{
  orderId: "940",
  status: "active"
}
*/
