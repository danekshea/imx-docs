Welcome to the Learn section of our documentation. This section focuses on general Web3 knowledge aimed at maximizing the success of your project. For technical guides and code implementation, check out our [build section](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs/start-here). 

Introduction
------------

From our experience launching [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) - we know that a successful Web3 game requires execution on more than just the technical front.  From rallying a loyal community, to creating a sustainable economy, and pitching to venture capitalists - it can be difficult to know where to start.  

Our aim is to provide a high level overview of many foundational concepts and share actionable insights on how you can incorporate them into your project. As you read through our content, remember that Web3 is continually evolving and there are no definitive answers. We can only share with you what we’ve learned and observed from our own experiences and over time these guides will grow. We hope that you’ll take this knowledge as a baseline and experiment to the best of your ability!
