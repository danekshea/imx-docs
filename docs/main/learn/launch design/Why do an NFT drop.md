**Pre-game NFT releases: best practices from ImmutableX**

Game studios developing on ImmutableX often ask us about project phasing - whether they should release NFTs before launch, or focus all their efforts on finalising their game. We have combined our experiences with almost a hundred projects across the protocol to help answer this question with a best practice guide

_Tl;dr - executing an NFT release before your game launches remains the most effective way to phase your project_

The benefits of releasing NFTsprior to game launch fall into five categories:

1. Funding
2. User acquisition
3. Technical integration
4. Game loops
5. Time to market

**Funding**

NFT sales are a key funding source for emerging projects. An initial sale of assets provides a cash injection, and royalties (natively enforced on ImmutableX) provide a recurring cash flow from secondary trading activity. A recent example is Edenbrawl (Sparkadia), manned by a team of ex-Riot, Bungie and EA veterans, who released a series of 10,000 game characters pre-launch to fundraise and secure a runway to finalise game development.

**User acquisition**

NFT releases are a powerful user acquisition opportunity, especially where a playable game is not yet available to attract potential players. We think about user acquisition with NFTs along some key themes:

- _As a bet for early adopters:_ Selling NFTs provides an opportunity for early adopters to be rewarded for subsequent game growth, and can attract investor/earner personas as well as players (see [Naavik](https://naavik.co/digest/blockchain-players)). This not only increases your potential audience, but creates a group of holders who are financially incentivised to drive users and interest to your project. Our recommendation in current market conditions is to release an NFT with a utility linked to game growth or success rather than raw speculation. For example, Illuvium's land plots, which generate resources that are a prerequisite for gameplay - thus demand and value scales with players
- _As a viral onboarding loop:_ Releasing low-value NFTs as airdrops or transfers to players who sign up and complete community-growing actions (referring friends, interacting with posts, etc) is a powerful loop to onboard players and bootstrap early growth. Players holding NFTs not only have an incentive to see the game succeed and have their utility grow, but also have the opportunity to begin trading, which propagates your collection to new users. PlanetQuest's viral loop was so effective that ImmutableX commissioned an open source version for our ecosystem!

- _As community incentives and an alternative to advertising:_ Guild of Guardians offered low-value NFTs to new joiners and referrers in a more directly transactional way than PlanetQuest above, and grew to 250k+ community members at a significantly lower cost of acquisition than advertising. In addition, low-value NFTs and whitelists to higher-value NFTs were awarded for pro-community behaviours to further grow users and strengthen the community. Importantly these were retroactively awarded to avoid abuse

**Technical integration**

Minting and releasing NFTs are the simplest activities to execute on ImmutableX for new developers. By releasing NFTs early in the project timeline, you are able to get familiar with ImmutableX technical interactions which de-risks future timelines and opens up opportunities to develop the game and the blockchain elements in parallel. EmberSword is a recent major project who intentionally migrated and re-minted assets from a competing protocol early in their development cycle (game launch in late 2023) to establish early wins on the technical integration front and de-risk their launch

**Game loops**

Similar to the above, releasing NFTs pre-game allows for experimentation and the creation of novel game loops even before the game is finalised. This opens up the opportunity space for your project, and allows early feedback from users. CyberGalz released avatars and accessories well before their game, and used that period to experiment with crafting and dynamic NFTs using ImmutableX features, creating a novel loop of customisation for Galz that was iterated and refined even before the game released to users

**Time to market**

Finally, releasing NFTs before game launch drastically improves time to market for your project. The Web3 gaming space is facing unprecedented investment and builders, but very few live projects. This is exacerbated by macro sentiment generally reducing speculation. There is a unique opportunity to capture attention with a strategic NFT release tied to a broader game narrative, rather than building in stealth and trying to carve out attention alongside many competitors when market activity grows and/or when more games release. Blocklords, a major game not releasing until 2023, has taken the opportunity to aggressively market a rolling cadence of airdrops, early access redemptions, and NFT sales, all accompanied by compelling pre-gameplay footage and a AAA narrative
