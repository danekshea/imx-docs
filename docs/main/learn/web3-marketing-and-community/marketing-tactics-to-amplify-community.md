## Introduction

While community ultimately drives the success of a game launch or primary sale, marketing helps to amplify community efforts by increasing the visibility and reach of your project.

In this section, we'll explore a range of marketing tactics that can amplify the success of community activations, project announcements and sales, including:

- Website and branding
- Viral marketing
- Blog
- Press releases
- Email and paid Marketing
- Agencies and third-party support
- Partnerships - we have an entire article for this

There is no 'one size fits all approach' - with how early we are in Web3, marketing strategies have not matured and are constantly changing. They are a plethora of successful Web2 gaming projects and, beyond this, clever marketing execution of all sorts of products across the ages. These success stories can help you brainstorm ideas for your own campaigns, and adapting them to your project will save you resources that can be spent elsewhere.

It's also worth mentioning that mainstream coverage from Web2 outlets is seen as a positive health indicator for the project, given that it is harder to achieve than Web3 coverage. Thus, you will likely need to combine your [community-building efforts](building-communities-in-different-channels) with marketing strategies for both Web2 and Web3 audiences.

## **Website and Branding**

The project website is the first channel most users will engage with to understand the project and is the primary funnel to other channels.

**A great website should:**

1. Have a consistent and professional aesthetic
2. Convey a consistent sense of visual branding and lore
3. Have high-level information immediately accessible
4. Route users to other channels, such as Discord, as easily as possible.

SEO should be a focus as users will abandon a project if they cannot find it by name immediately on Google, even if the website link is available on other channels.

## **Viral marketing**

Newsworthy and shareable content leads to viral marketing - meaning that your community will market and share your project for you. This can drive positive sentiment and is considered a green flag for project health. There isn't a formula for engineering virality, however here are two considerations:

1. What's share-worthy (e.g. what's memorable)
2. What will drive a sense of urgency for a customer to act (including sharing)

Shareability can come from various mechanics - this could be big funding news via a reputable media source, something more organic via a sharing mechanic to get earlier access, or perhaps trying something entirely novel.

## **Blog**

While Discord and Twitter provide short real-time updates on project information, a long-form blog can support more substantial content. This blog can be part of the main website (such as [Gods Unchained](https://blog.godsunchained.com/)) or a separate Medium account (such as [Guild of Guardians](https://guildofguardians.medium.com/)).

Here are some examples of blog content:

- [Commentary on latest events](https://www.immutable.com/blog/deep-dive-immutable-the-merge)
- [Gameplay tutorials](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2022/10/06/gods-unchained-game-modes/)
- [Development updates](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2022/08/11/dev-update-august/)
- [Team member spotlight](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2022/10/06/meet-the-team/)
- [Partnership announcements or spotlights](https://www.immutable.com/blog/aqua-partner-profile)
- [Lore updates](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2022/09/28/cosmic-shift-mechanics/)

## **Press Releases**

Press releases are another channel to broadcast information. They are less impactful for Web3 audiences as these users rely more on Twitter and Discord. However, press releases are a great way to gain coverage from mainstream audiences and Web2 gamers. Some examples of information you could include:

- Key hires from major publishers or studios
- Collection launches
- Fundraising announcements

## **Email Marketing**

Email marketing can be used for projects with multiple launches over a sustained period. Emails can be collected on the website or through a landing page associated with events or giveaways. By providing regular updates through emails, you can experiment with content, copy and headlines to find what increases email open rates. Make sure you get your own legal advice to make sure how you collect user emails and undertake email marketing complies with all relevant laws and regulations.

## **Paid Advertising**

Paid Marketing can have a direct impact on the reach and visibility of a key announcement.

Opportunities for paid amplification of posts include:

- Launch Trailers (YouTube, Twitter)
- Key Announcements Videos (YouTube, Twitter)
- Events Promotions (Twitter)

Note: Some platforms have terms and conditions around paid promotions on cryptocurrency, NFT and competitions in addition to relevant laws and regulations. These should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis ahead of any paid promotion.

## **Agencies and Third Parties**

Engaging agencies or third parties can be helpful if your team needs additional support. Here are some examples of services offered:

- Strategic Planning and Advisory
- Content Creation and Social Media Management
- Discord Creation and Moderation
- Influencer and Partnership Networking
- Website and Landing Page Development
