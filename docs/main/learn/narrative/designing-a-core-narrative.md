- An introduction to the product, emotion and mission framework

## Introduction

Designing a project narrative is one of the first steps in any Web3 project as it influences almost every project decision moving forwards. This includes the way you build your community, the game design itself, and how you communicate to players. This article will introduce you to a framework you can use as a starting point. From there you can test, learn and build on it over time.

## Product, emotion, and mission

A great core narrative is aspiring and exciting, it sells on multiple fronts. Successful projects also have narratives that transcend their short term product realities, balancing the current product with its future state. Some key selling elements are:

- **Product** : What is the game, expressed in its most aspirational and exciting way?
- **Emotion** : What should players feel about it?
- **Mission:** Why should players join you? What is your call to action to the world?

The project's narrative should be explicitly defined in a few sentences. Once set, the core narrative should not change. This is your driving vision, and changes will dilute its presence. In future articles we will introduce the idea of sub-narratives, which are elements that can be revised over time.

## Building out the elements of your core narrative

**Product**

The simplest way to get something down on paper is to start with why you're different - the "Product" component of the key selling elements. This could be as follows:

- Unique functions or features
- Deep lore and content
- World-class or unique art

What doesn't work here is when you just describe your game in very straight forward terms, without the differentiator. An example is:

- A Web3 game that is "gameplay-first"
- AAA-quality

**Emotion**

Emotion speaks to the ethos of the project, for example:

- Reciprocity and commitment, "we reward our players"
- Unity and belonging, "come find your tribe"
- Social proof, "big brands back us"

We suggest avoiding purely speculative or value extractive levers as these do not tap into the emotional base effectively:

- "Play to earn"
- "Sell what you win"

**Mission**

And finally, the unique mission could be something such as: Used judiciously, evocation of other successes, e.g. links to similar AAA Web2 games. Be careful not to dilute your presence or tie your success to other project's.

What doesn't work is when there's no mission and future aspiration beyond "play the game" or "come and earn". For example associating closely to another project, diluting presence. "Fortnite with NFTs", "Axie but with stable tokenomics"

We suggest reading [developing sub narratives](designing-sub-narratives) which helps you target your narrative to different audiences and also includes a template for you to fill out.
