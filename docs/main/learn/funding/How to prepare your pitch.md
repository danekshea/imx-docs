## Introduction

Pitching to an investor is as much an art as a science. Perfecting the perfect pitch is a great entryway to not only open investment doors, but also allow you to better position your project for all your stakeholders. A simple way to think of your pitch is: 'why should investors care about my project'.

Literature on how to approach a pitch and examples of great pitches have existed for a long while, the most useful guides are those popularised in the silicon valley startup space in the past 10 years.

Included here is a series of helpful tips we've collected around the internet to help you get into the right frame of mind when developing your pitch.

## Before you start developing

Before you put pen down on paper, it's important to get clarity on:

- Your intended target investor
- Your game and project narrative
- Medium of the pitch

As discussed in the [Understanding the Investor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHQ14sunyDXlMKtrpvSwmFZrK9nNdh5zsB_1w10Tujs/edit#) topic, you should be prepared to develop multiple pitches depending on who the investor is, there should be no sacred cows when it comes to distilling and targeting the right message to the right audience.

Once you understand the investor, you'll need to adapt your game and project narrative to what the investor is looking for. Answering key questions on why they should care about your project, and invest in it. Some common questions are online in our [common investor questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16UuXdEN18yl4RDbvUcPL7M9wZRDYXUcW39xbu5-Vnw0/edit) article.

The medium of your pitch will help you determine an appropriate length and structure. Here are a few examples of different channels:

- In person presentation
- Video calls
- Discussion documents
- Coffee chats
- Send ahead read decks

You should use the Appendix of your pitch deck to highlight additional information from pitch discussions..A great set of appendices is really worth its weight in gold. t signals to investors that you know how to prioritize and that you have considered all the details and you're ready to provide more details.

To populate your appendix, start by thinking about the most common discussion points This might include:

- Revenue opportunities and detailed roadmaps
- Financial models and cashflow forecasts
- Competitive analysis and market analysis
- Detailed team, investor and partner profiles
- Tokenomics breakdown
- Technical architecture diagrams

## Developing your pitch

Developing your pitch is an exercise of structure, wordsmithing and practice. Like an enthralling movie script or engaging television advert, there's a lot that goes into your pitch from the macro (overarching story and structure) to the micro (dialogue with pause and effect).

**Basic structure**

A good starting point is to answer some typical headings a pitch would cover. These include:

- Problem and solution
- Size of opportunity
- Ideal customer
- Go-to-market plans and traction
- Monetisation
- Competitors and why we are better
- Team
- Funding ask

One way to practice how to answer these questions in a basic pitch is to follow this universal template [link: [https://www.slideshare.net/liubinskas/universal-startup-pitch-deck](https://www.slideshare.net/liubinskas/universal-startup-pitch-deck)] developed by Pollenizer Australia.

**Developing your storylines**

Once you have the basics down, it's important to then think about bigger picture, a good way to frame for this is discussed in this video by VC Brendan Baker [link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr1PKaoflLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr1PKaoflLo)]. The key concept here is to think about your pitch as a series of connected stories. You might start with a "pain and response" story, then tell the story of how early things you've done shows evidence it's working and ultimately go to a story which tells why you've built the best team to conquer this massive problem or opportunity.

**The extra 20%**

Finally, pitching is a performance, especially when you do it in person, in competition, on a stage. The ability to use the physical space, dialogue (including pauses) in conjunction with your slides makes the best pitches even better. Take inspiration from of the best TED talks you've no doubt watched.

Some ways to think about this are as follows:

- [Dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfHXJ8fAwg) - what makes the best Youtube ads great that makes you don't want to skip them? 
- [Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGirACdmiLM) - what makes stage presence matter that makes you glued to the person on stage? 
- [Put it all together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FOCpMAww28) - what makes the best TED talks great? 

Other simple tips include:

- Engineer for memorability - The best pitches will leave you with something to remember. Consider adding, innovative turn-of-phrase, motifs which you repeat through your presentation, use of exceptional imagery or using the stage in your physical performance.
- Think about what wins hearts - Engagement in your story comes from your ability to connect with the investor. Looking for ways to engage the heart and not just the mind is key. This can be achieved via personalizing the story, making the pain universal for those listening and aiming to entertain, not just to inform.
- Be passionate - Passion goes a long way to win hearts, within reason. You see many overexcited performers audition for TV idol shows and fail before the adrenalin carries them off course. It's important to be passionate on the basis of confidence and mastery of your subject matter and mission. Investors should be left with the impression that you are the best person to solve the problem.
- Tune into the audience in real time - Controlling the discussion is also super important, this gravitas shows investors you can run a project and company. So tuning into non verbal cues to drill into details where there's interest and also moving the conversation along and parking then reiterating points of interest later on are useful skills to have.
- Practice, practice, practice - Finally, nothing beats practice. You should look at every opportunity to pitch as practice, from the social conversation, to the elevator pitch to a formal competition. As a base, learn the exact words, then once you're a master, throw it away and play with it to iterate and refine with every pitch opportunity.
