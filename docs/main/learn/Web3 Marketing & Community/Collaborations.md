# Collaborations and partnerships

Collaborations in Web3 enable you to expand the reach of your project and improve your user acquisition. While it's tempting to DM everyone you know in crypto Twitter, we'll cover a few topics to ensure that you choose collaborations that make the most sense for your project.

## Before you reach out

To maximize your chances of success in any collaboration, ensure that your project meets a few baseline industry standards:

- An active social media presence with a healthy sharing cadence.
- A basic roadmap with tangible goals and concrete deadlines.
- A clear vision and narrative
- A website with key project information
- (Ideally) - a working product, gameplay, or demo

## Types of collaboration

A successful partnership strategy connects two parties and is focused on mutually benefiting both parties. Here are a few examples:

1. **Influencer partnerships**
2. **Community collaborations**
3. **Brand partnerships**
4. **Marketplaces**
5. **Games**

In this article, we'll explore influencers and community collaborators.

## Influencers partnerships

Web3 influencers are individuals that can convince others to join your project. They can be whales with large portfolios, subject matter experts, or any user with a loyal following. They are most effective at persuading others when they are seen as investing in a project based on their interests rather than a paid partnership.

One way to categorize them is based on their number of followers:

- Micro-influencers - smaller following of users that are more engaged
- Macro-influencers - large following of less engaged users

Macro influences may have exponentially more followers than micro-influencers; however, there will be fewer users that are genuinely interested in their content. Additionally, macro influencers will cost more to work with.

When choosing influencers, you should consider the following:

- Cost
- The audience, tone of voice, and track record of your influencer
- Deliverables and timeline
- Content - ensure their feedback is positive and that they value your project.
- Are they doxxed?

## Community collaborations

In Web3, community partnerships are considered the gold standard of marketing. The benefits of collaboration have withstood the test of time and market conditions and prevail in impact and cost-effectiveness. These types of partnerships can be done between your game and a PFP project or your game and another game (with precaution not to dilute your audiences).

**Why collab?**

- **Outreach:** When you collaborate with a partner, you get free access to their entire community. Any communications you agree upon with your partner will therefore be broadcast to potentially thousands of new people.
- **It's (usually) free.** No good collab partner will ask you for any spending, since the collaboration should always be mutually beneficial. The only cost for collaboration would be the resources you dedicate to building it (for example, creating custom assets).
- **It builds trust.** An established project will often have a tight-knit community and trusted leadership that the community listens to. Anything they see as being promoted by their leaders, they are likely to consider a more secure investment opportunity.

**Questions specific for evaluating an influencer**
