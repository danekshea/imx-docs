- What is marketing and community
- Why marketing and community is important

## Introduction

We like to think of community as a noun and marketing as the verb that accompanies this noun:

- Community is the collection of your fans and collaborators
- Marketing is how you get your fans and collaborators

**Community** can include anyone that interacts with your project. These individuals can often be grouped into segments with similar characteristics and interests. Projects can segment however they like - a common method is via channels, e.g. Discord and Twitter. Another way of segmenting is via profiles, or roles in the ecosystem, e.g. players and investors.

Some channels and profiles might overlap, meaning that certain channels might be predominantly a singular profile (i.e. GitHub and developers). In contrast, other channels might have multiple profiles (i.e. Discord has players and investors). Understanding these differences early means you'll be able to modulate your community strategies to make the most impact.

**Marketing** refers to the strategies and activities undertaken to build your community and brand. Managing social media channels like Discord or Reddit are included in marketing, though it extends beyond this. It encompasses all the ways you communicate with your community, from events (like AMAs or IRL events), to social media posts (tone, content, timing), to partnerships and beyond.

In Web3, marketing and community go hand in hand in ensuring the success of your project.

## Why is marketing & community important?

From Immutable's extensive experience launching Web3 titles, including God's Unchained, Guild of Guardians, and Illuvium, it's clear that an active community is foundational to success in Web3 gaming.

Strong communities help projects to achieve their goals in numerous ways:

- Grow the project via network effects
- Cocreate the ecosystem - e.g. content creators and builders
- Defend your project against FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
- Amplify marketing efforts
- Create positive sentiment

While projects have no control over external factors like market conditions, the community is one factor that projects can actively seek to influence. It also helps that Web3 communities are more active than Web2 communities - as many users are invested financially and emotionally in the success of projects.

## How to build a community?

There is no silver-bullet solution to building an engaged and sustained community, however, there are principles that can be followed to set up a project for success. The articles below will provide a few high-level approaches you can follow based on our experience.
