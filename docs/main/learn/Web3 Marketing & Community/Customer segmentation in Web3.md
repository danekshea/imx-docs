- An introduction to customer segmentation
- Why you should segment
- A sample framework on segmentation

## Introduction

Customer segmentation involves splitting your users into groups with similar characteristics and interests. This should be one of the first activities you conduct, as the segments you define have a direct impact on how you market and communicate to each segment.

## Key benefits

The purpose of segmentation is to help structure and test your strategy and tactics as you develop and execute them. This allows you to better empathize deeply with the customer and their needs.

## How to segment
Your customer segments and the relative attention you give to each segment today vs tomorrow, will differ depending on your lifecycle stage, your game mission, the type of game you're building, your target demographic, and a range of other factors.

Here is a **general** framework for Web3 users. Having a logical split between customers makes it easier to differentiate between them - eg crypto native or not and player vs investor.

Note: You may wish to develop your own segments further based on your project needs. For example, players can also be separated into lifecycles (1-30 days or 30+ days) - these groups will have significantly different behaviours and interests.

## Template

This template can be used as a preliminary exercise to segment your customers and determine tactics for each segment.

1. We have filled in the first row as an example
2. Fill in the other questions for each of your segments - they may vary from the examples we have used
3. The tactics you focus on will be the ones that best serve your target segments
