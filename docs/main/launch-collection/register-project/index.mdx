A project is an administrative-level entity that is associated with an owner address, which is your [wallet address](../register-as-user/index.md).

A project can have many [collections](../register-collection/index.mdx).

The best way to create a project is to use the [imx-examples](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#2-create-project) repository.

### Steps:
1. [Signup to the Immutable Developer Hub]()
2. [Register a project](#1-register-a-project)
3. [Get details about your projects](#2-get-details-about-your-projects)

## 1. Signup to the Immutable Developer Hub

Register your email address on the [Immutable Developer Hub](https://hub.immutable.com) to get access to customised documentation and the ability to create projects on Immutable.

Projects are required to create collections which subsequently allow minting assets on Immutable (L2).

When creating a project the `contact_email` parameter needs to be a email address that has been registered and verified on the Developer Hub. Attempting to create a project without registered and verified email address will return an error if the onboarding flow was not completed.

:::caution Project ownership cannot be transferred
Once a project is registered to a particular wallet address (public key), it cannot be changed. Make sure that the wallet you use to register a project is one that you have adequate security management for.

## 2. Register a project

Follow the [2. Create project steps](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/onboarding.md#2-create-project) in the imx-examples repository.

## 3. Get details about your projects
Including checking your project [limits](#limits).

Get:
* [List of projects](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/administration.md#get-a-list-of-projects) that you are the owner of
* [Details of a project by ID](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/docs/administration.md#get-a-project-by-id) (you must be the project owner)

## Limits
### Collection limits:
* Projects are limited to **five collections** within a **four-week period**
* The four-week period starts from the moment a collection is created
* If a collection's request is sent that exceeds this limit, the request will fail, returning an error with a status code of `429` and a message of "Collection limit exceeded"
* If four weeks have elapsed since the previous collection was created, a new four-week window starts from the time the next request is made
* Project limit information will be included in response headers when a request fails due to the limit being exceeded, and also when a request is successful

**Response information includes:**

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `collection_remaining` | How many collections remain for the four-week time period |
