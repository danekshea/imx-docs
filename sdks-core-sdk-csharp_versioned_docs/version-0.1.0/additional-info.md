# Additional info

## Get data

These methods allow you to read data about events, transactions or current state on ImmutableX (layer 2). They do not require any user authentication because no state is being changed.

Examples of the types of data that are typically retrieved include:

- Assets or details of a particular asset
- Token balances for a particular user
- Orders or details about a particular order
- Historical trades and transfers

### Examples

#### Get all collections and get assets from a particular collection:

```csharp
using Imx.Sdk.Gen.Client;
using Imx.Sdk.Gen.Model;
using Imx.Sdk;

try
{
    Client client = new Client(new Config() {
        Environment = EnvironmentSelector.Sandbox
    });

    // List collections
    ListCollectionsResponse resultListCollections = client.ListCollections(pageSize: 2);
    
    if (resultListCollections.Result.Count > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("List Collections Response: " + resultListCollections.ToJson());
        
        // Get the first item in collection
        var collection = resultListCollections.Result[0];
        // Get a list of assets
        ListAssetsResponse resultListAssets = client.ListAssets(collection: collection.Address, pageSize: 10);
        Console.WriteLine("List Assets Response: " + resultListAssets.ToJson());
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("No Collections found!");
    }
}
catch (ApiException  e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Exception when calling Api: " + e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Console.WriteLine(e.StackTrace);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error message: " + e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine(e.StackTrace);
}
```

### API autogenerated code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the [public APIs](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference). The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.

To re-generate the API client, run:

```make
make generate-openapi-prod
```

### Changelog management

This repository is using [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to manage the CHANGELOG.md.

The following headings should be used as appropriate

- **Added**
- **Changed**
- **Deprecated**
- **Removed**
- **Fixed**

This is an example with all the change headings. For actual usage, use only the one heading that is relevant. This goes at the top of the CHANGELOG.md above the most recent release.

```markdown
